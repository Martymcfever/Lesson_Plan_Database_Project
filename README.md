READ ME File:

This webpage will be titled Teachers Help Teachers: a database website where teachers can put their lesson plans or worksheets for other teachers to access, or, more importantly, for substitutes to access.

In addition to being able to add items to the website's database, users can leave comments on these items to give feedback or give their input on the materials.

To use this webpage, you will go to the url and search for items via the subject of the materials, by grade level, or with a search bar to look up specific titles. You will then be met with a feed of items based on your search filters.

To add items to the database, you will hit the add item button and fill out a form to input the materials. The form will need the title of materials, list of contributors, subject area, grade level, and a description of the materials.

To quickly understand the utility of an item, users can leave a numeric rating out of five stars and an optional qualitative review.


Release Notes:

Code Milestone 1: Added the Post model to the Django project to act as the database for websites materials. Some front end aspects have been implemented.
