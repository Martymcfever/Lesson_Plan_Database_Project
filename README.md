This webpage will be titled Teachers Help Teachers: a database website where teachers can put their lesson plans or worksheets for other teachers to access, or, more importantly, for substitutes to access.

In addition to being able to add items to the website's database, users can leave comments on these items to give feedback or give their input on the materials.

To use this webpage, you will go to the url and search for items via the subject of the materials, by grade level, or with a search bar to look up specific titles. You will then be met with a feed of items based on your search filters.

To add items to the database, you will hit the add item button and fill out a form to input the materials. The form will need the title of materials, list of contributors, subject area, grade level, and a description of the materials.

To quickly understand the utility of an item, users can leave a numeric rating out of five stars and an optional qualitative review.


Release Notes:

Code Milestone 1: Added the Post model to the Django project to act as the database for websites materials. Some front end aspects have been implemented.

Code Milestone 2: The add function has been implemented and is usable to add items to the Post Django model. In addition the features to search for items by title has been implemented. We are able to view the items and see all fields. While a button to download lesson plans has been created on the front end we are still working on the backend aspect and pland to have it be a priority for milestone 3. Looking forward to milestone 3, we will get the download function working, be able to search by different fields of a model object, implement the verification system, and getting testing more developed.
